    On Earth, the human race discovered technology that allows them to detect habitable planets and go to them, around the speed 
    of light.  Some humans took part in a program, mission Artemis, which they got paid to go and explore other planets. 
    These humans built a spaceship and journeyed to the “Gliese 667Cc”, which is about 22.18 light years away from Earth. 
    Little did they know, there was a modern civilization inhabiting the planet, and now, the fate of both the human race and the 
    alien race depends on the hands of the human. In the spaceship they are given choices that result in different consequences.
